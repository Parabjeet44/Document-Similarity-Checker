# Document-Similarity-Checker
Document Similarity Checker is a program that compares the content of multiple 
text documents and determines how similar they are to each other. It is useful for 
identifying related documents, detecting plagiarism, or finding duplicates in a 
collection of texts. Python Document Similarity Checker Program uses files to 
provide the following functions: 
Document Similarity Checker can be created using basic data structures of Python 
such as lists and dictionaries, along with efficient algorithms like binary search. 
Lists in Python provide a way to store multiple items in a single variable. In this 
project, lists are used to store document contents, preprocessed words, and file 
names. Dictionaries are used to store word frequencies, providing fast lookup 
times. The combination of sorted lists and binary search algorithm enables efficient 
word comparisons across documents. The entire collection of documents can be 
processed and compared using these data structures. By iterating through the lists 
and utilizing the dictionary's fast lookup capability, we can calculate similarity 
scores between documents efficiently. The binary search algorithm further 
optimizes the process by allowing quick word lookups in sorted lists, significantly 
improving performance for larger documents
